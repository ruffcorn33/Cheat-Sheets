# Node.js

  Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

  Node is server-side JavaScript.  It is independent of html.

  The non-blocking feature of Node make it asynchronous and capable of handling many connections concurrently.

  The Node.js process object is a *global* that provides information about, and control over, the current Node.js process.  As a global, it is always available to Node.js applications without using require().

  The __*process.argv()*__ - property returns an array containing the command line arguments passed when a Node.js process is launched.  The first element [0] will be the process.execPAth.  The second element [1] will be the path to the JS file being executed.  The remaining elements [2], [3] ... will be additional command line arguments.
